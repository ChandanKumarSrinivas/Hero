## Tales of Heritage

This project is an interactive storytelling platform I built using Streamlit and Snowflake to highlight Indiaâ€™s diverse cultural heritage and promote responsible tourism through real government data. While developing it, I sourced datasets from data.gov.in to analyze tourism trends, explore seasonal patterns, and identify lesser-known cultural destinations that are often overlooked. I integrated Snowflake with Streamlit to run live SQL queries and display dynamic insights through interactive charts and maps. I also dug into how government investments in art and culture tie into tourism development, using that data to build a narrative that is both informative and engaging. My goal was to create a platform that not only educates users about India's traditional art forms and experiences but also encourages sustainable travel choices through a seamless, data first experience.
